 **Synapse Library:** [Edit this to link directly to your public Synapse Library](https://www.synapse.org/)  
  >*Free account registration is required to download files from Synapse.*  
 
 **Images and metadata are available in the bucket at the following AWS location:** [ADD BUCKET DETAILS]   
  >*Files available through AWS S3 are made available using a “requester pays” model.*   
  >*The person downloading the data must have an AWS account, and AWS will charge the user's account $0.10/GB for downloading all or part 
of the data.*
 
*Note About Accessing AWS Data:*

>To browse and download the data use either a graphical file transfer application
that supports S3 such as [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io), or the [AWS CLI
tools](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/). A graphical tool may be more convenient but
the CLI tools will likely offer higher download speeds. Please refer to the
documentation for your chosen tool on how to sign in and enable access to
requester-pays buckets. There is unfortunately no web-browser-based mechanism
for accessing a requester-pays bucket. Keep in mind the download costs, which
will run over $200 for downloading one copy of the entire dataset. For users who
wish to perform processing within AWS to avoid transfer charges, note that the
bucket is located in the `us-east-1` region so any other resources must be
instantiated in this same region.
