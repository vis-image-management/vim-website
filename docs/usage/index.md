### Rendering
| ![image](https://github.com/vis-image-management/vim-website/assets/31503434/34e2255b-7e05-4f32-8527-2030db57efcf) | Rendering concerns the computational process of generating a photorealistic or non-photorealistic image from a 2D or 3D data. In the context of biomedical imaging we work on scalable rendering methods for display of and real-time interaction with multiplexed 2D and 3D imaging data. We especially tackle 2D and 3D multi-resolution rendering approaches for the web, allowing the biomedical community to easily access, and display the vast terrabyte-sized (often multiplexed) imaging data. |
